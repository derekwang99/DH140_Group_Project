Include the following sections:

Project title and link to proposal:

Roles (only for groups): Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."

Status update: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.

Data update: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.

Concerns: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."

 # LA Businesses: COVID-19
 Proposal: https://github.com/derekwang99/DH140_Group_Project/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/readme.md
 
 ## Roles
 * Derek: 
 * Henry: As a data specialist and content developer, I oversee the data exploration of our datasets as well as help shape the narrative of project. I plan on exploring our Active LA Business dataset as a next step and hope to find interesting insights relating to our research questions.
 
 ## Status Update
 * Derek
 * Henry: I think our work flow so far has been pretty good, as we've made tactile progress with our data explorations (e.g., census data). However, I know things are only going to get busier for us due to midterms and outside commitments, so we need to be more diligent with our planning. I propose that we aim to finish weekly assignments one or two days before deadlines, so we have a buffer to fine tune our outputs.
