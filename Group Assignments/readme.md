Create a markdown page (optionally, you may choose to upload a PDF), which will be your group's project proposal. Make sure to include the following:

- An introduction of your research question
- An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
- A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
- A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
- Include datasource with links
- A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project
- A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research

## Research Question
This past year has proven incredibly difficult and unrehearsed, as we continue this drawn-out battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March of 2020, the US has implemented numerous legislations and guidelines in an attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus. Not only were our personal lives impacted by these rapid changes (e.g., enforced masks, social distancing, limited gatherings) but we also saw dramatic changes in the workforce: shuttered down offices, massive layoffs, and dampened outlook on the economy. And while certain businesses, namely large corporations, have managed to stay afloat through remote work or company mandated testing, small entrepreneurs and business owners do not have this flexibility.

As LA residents who see the effects of the pandemic and recession on the economy, we propose the following research questions: **"How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the population of businesses in Los Angeles? But on a deeper level, how do power dynamics of capital and access determine which businesses can stay afloat amidst these difficult realities?"**

## Why Research Matters
This research is important to us because we want to better understand the correlation between the pandemic and the economy by tracing the spread of the virus and the number of active businesses. Data showing infected cases, deaths, and closed businesses not only serve as the material condition for our research but ultimately contextualize human experiences and shows that this pandemic has had big impacts on our health as well as the way we financially sustain ourselves. By investigating this topic, we can provide insights to business owners and entrepreneurs who may want to work in LA during a pandemic.

## Spatial Scope
Our spatial scope is centered in Los Angeles, and we will segment active businesses by different zip codes (e.g., Culver City vs Koreatown) to compare business operations in more affluent areas to lower-income ones. As a result, space and time are essential concepts to our project because we get to contextualize the total number of COVID-19 cases to active businesses over time.
