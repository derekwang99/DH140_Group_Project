Create a markdown page (optionally, you may choose to upload a PDF), which will be your group's project proposal. Make sure to include the following:

- An introduction of your research question
- An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
- A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
- A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
- Include datasource with links
- A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project
- A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research
