 # LA Businesses: COVID-19
 Proposal: https://github.com/derekwang99/DH140_Group_Project/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/readme.md
 
 ## Roles
 * Derek: I plan to be the data visualization/mapping specialist and plan to help with content development. In regards to our Active LA Business dataset, I plan to focus on The Bel Air/Century portion of our project, and will try to incorporate our COVID dataset into our analysis should the dataset fit our needs. 
 * Henry: As a data specialist and content developer, I oversee the data exploration of our datasets as well as help shape the narrative of project. I plan on exploring our Active LA Business dataset as a next step and hope to find interesting insights relating to our research questions.
 
 ## Status Update
 * Derek: This week or following week, I will try to calculate the proportion of businesses against all buildings within each city of interest. Perhaps cities with a greater proportion of businesses also have greater median household incomes? Perhaps the decrease in number of active businesses (and consequently lower proportion of businesses) resulted in a decrease in median household income? It is likely that we do not have the data to support this, so this is just theoretical. On another note, I am just exploring the landscape of Century City to see if anything in particular is of interest in the individual assignment. 
 * Henry: I think our work flow so far has been pretty good, as we've made tactile progress with our data explorations (e.g., census data). However, I know things are only going to get busier for us due to midterms and outside commitments, so we need to be more diligent with our planning. I propose that we aim to finish weekly assignments one or two days before deadlines, so we have a buffer to fine tune our outputs.
 
 ## Data Update:
I plan exploring the Active LA Business dataset as a part of this week's individual coding assignment. And Derek will take a look at our COVID-19 dataset(?) We also came across this [dataset](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker) that tracks fluctuations in the economy during COVID-19, so we'll find time to explore this dataset, too.

## Concerns
* Major:
    * Finding insights from our LA business and COVID-19 dataset. I'm scared that we won't find anything of substance or pertaining to our research questions.
    * May have to scrap/redirect research questions in this worst case scenario(?)
* Minor:
    * Be a little more time conscientious
